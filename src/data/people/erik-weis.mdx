I am a Master's student at the Vermont Complex Systems Center, where I study decision-making in the context of spreading models on networks. My work surrounds leverages tools from Bayesian inference and statistical physics to design robust interventions under structural and dynamical uncertainty. More broadly, I'm interested in how complex systems models can inform decision-making in a wide range policy contexts, especially related housing, transportation networks, and the economy writ large.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing the piano and spending time outdoors.
