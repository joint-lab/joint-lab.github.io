I am a Master's student at the Vermont Complex Systems Center. I'm motivated to understand the mechanisms that govern our social, political, and economic systems. Morever, I hope that a complex systems perspective will help us design policies to address problems that stem from our connectedness.  I received my bachelors from Dartmouth in 2018,  where I majored in physics and minored in human-centered design.

In my free time, I am an avid pianist, I'm learning the guitar, and I enjoy the outdoors.
