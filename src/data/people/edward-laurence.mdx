## Biography

I am an Ai research scientist and partner at Hectiq.ai. I apply and develop machine learning solutions to industrial problems (see Voxmedia's example). I also enjoy developing frontend (Web, iOS) and backend apps to support the deployment of models.

In 2020, I completed my PhD degree in theoretical physics at Université Laval. My thesis introduces new methods to analyze resilience on graphs and helps answering certain questions: When does an ecosystem will breakdown? How can we infer the cause of problems in an ecosystem by looking at the species populations? My contributions also impact other types of graphs such as the brain and social webs.

## Research interests

### Graph analysis

I've been working with graphs since 2014 and I've been following the rise of Ai on graphs since its onset. My expertise is both rooted into a deep theoretical and practical view, brought by my graduate studies in graphs and my participation into a large-scale use of Ai on graphs with Voxmedia.

### Segmentation
Segmentation has been an authentic leitmotif of multiple industrial projects that I've worked on. I've been joggling and building up 1D (time series), 2D (images), 3D (volume), and sparse (graphs) models to achieve instance segmentation.

### Time series analysis
Time series are complex creatures as their nature dictates so many of their properties. I've been working with correlated time series on graphs (imagine that each element of a graph is a sensor interacting with other sensors) and independent analysis as well (heartbeat, rainfall time series), including forecasting, segmentation, and characterisation.

### Data visualization
Communicating results through images, animations and texts is a continuous challenge for researchers. I like to work through it by reading writing guides and using different visualizations and coding tools. My most useful viz assets include D3.js, Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Inkscape.
