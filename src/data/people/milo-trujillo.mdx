## Biography

Milo is a systems scientist interested in how governance models and platform design combine to shape community behavior. His past work includes studying the [effects of community bans on Reddit](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.16207.pdf), the growth of [alt-tech social media platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01984.pdf) in response to deplatforming, and comparing [open-source team collaboration on and off of GitHub](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15611.pdf). Related interests include intentional community design, networked counterpublics, and decentralized systems. Outside of the lab, Milo works with [Distributed Denial of Secrets](https://ddosecrets.com/) and the [Pursuance Project](https://pursuanceproject.org/) to connect journalists, activists, and researchers to leaked data.
