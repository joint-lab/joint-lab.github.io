I'm currently a second-year PhD student at the Vermont Complex System Center, actively involved with the Computational Ethics Lab and the <a href="https://verso.w3.uvm.edu/">VERSO</a> project, the open source program office at UVM. My thesis project focuses on understanding the impact of learning to code in science and how it influences the research group life cycles in the midst of the computational revolution. Using group-based models, I investigate the potential tension between group and individual benefits, given individual relative interests or costs to learn to code. 

I enjoy going on PhD sidequests, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@jstonge/allotaxonometer-4-all?collection=@jstonge/allotaxonometer">bringing others' works to life</a>, <a href="https://jstonge.github.io/teenyverse/posts/source-sink/">my own theoretical work</a>, examining <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10026">how people human biases impact the detection deepfakes in the wild</a>, or finding ways to use scientifically large language models.
