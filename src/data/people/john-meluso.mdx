Hello and welcome! I'm John Meluso [(he/him, they/them)](https://www.johnmeluso.com/positionality). I'm a Computational Social Scientist & Qualitative Researcher who studies **Organizing through the lens of Complex Systems**, especially related to **Communication, Diversity, and Design**.

I work with [Jim Bagrow](https://www.bagrow.com/) and [Laurent HÃ©bert-Dufresne](https://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/). In May, 2020, I completed my Doctorate of Philosophy at the **University of Michigan** in [Design Science](https://isd.engin.umich.edu/graduate-degree-programs/design-science/) where I studied Complex System Design with [Jesse Austin-Breneman](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/jesse-austin-breneman/) and Management & Organizations with [Jose Uribe](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jose-uribe). Also on my committee were [Scott Page](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/scottepage/) and [Lynette Shaw](https://lynetteashaw.com/).

I value making a difference in the lives of people, from determining (and addressing) the [root causes of toxic cultures in organizations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMdKnUrfBuD2eMcMpOF8CAj9Quyj2wsS/view), to designing [more inclusive work systems for a hybrid world](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wehsk/), and improving the [complex engineered systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12820) that pervade modern society. I'm always open to collaborating and mentoring, so don't hesitate to reach out!

I am currently on the [job market](https://www.johnmeluso.com/job-market)! Please contact me if you have any questions or for more information.
