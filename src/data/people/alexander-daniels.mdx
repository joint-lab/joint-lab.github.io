My goal is to understand the mathematical methods employed in the analysis of complex, interdisciplinary, and non-linear problems. By doing so, I hope to sharpen and deepen my intuitive understanding of the processes that govern strongly interacting systems of many bodies. Finally, I hope to become a skilled teacher as I share the quantitative beauty of science both inside and outside of the academic community.
