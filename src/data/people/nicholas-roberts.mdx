## Research interests

### Infectious Disease Modeling and Quantitative Epidemiology
I am broadly interested in infectious diseases from both public health and physiological perspectives. Recent projects include analyzing the impact of essential worker staffing choices on the course of novel outbreaks as well as predicting the heterogeneity of outcomes during early stage epidemics that arise primarily through the stochasticity of transmission events. Most of my work in modeling disaese spread in populations reflects the belief that it is important to consider both the inherent randomness of disease transmission and the underlying contact networks along which disease can spread. In particular, beyond the standard compartmental disease models, I tend to focus on dynamical models on networks as well as stochastic models. Current disease modeling projects include inferring metabolic pathways of protozoan parasites from partially observed transcriptomes and modeling disease surveillance at the population level to guide pandemic preparedness efforts.

### Model Inference
My desire to apply mathematical models in real world problems arising from epidemiolgy requires that the models are well able to generate output that "matches" observed data. A necessary step in this problem is inferring model parameters from data, this can be viewed either as a subset of mathematical inverse problems or model fitting. My ongoing interests in this field include developing appropriate likelihoods for Bayesian inference, inference problems in the presence of incomplete data, and using inference to guide model structure.

### Uncertainty Quantification
Given imperfect knowledge and models always being an abstraction of the world, when collaborating with clinicians or public health officials it is necessary I capture the uncertainty in a models predicted outcomes. The more traditional approach to forward uncertainty quantification, aka uncertainty propogation, is to generate probabilistic forecasts based on the fact that model parameters are never known exactly. This is a vital step in mathematical modeling, and especially in the aforementioned communicating of predictions. An aspect of this approach I find particularly interesting is integrating inverse uncertainty quantification (calibration and or fitting of a model) with forward uncertainty propogation. In particular, I hope to contribute to the theory which attempts to explain how missing data impacts parameter uncertainty, thus indirectly impacting forward uncertainty quantification. Additionally, given that many aspects of an infectious diseases life history (both within host and between hosts) are best viewed as random in nature, I am interested in how the effects of parameter uncertainty compound with the inherently probabilistic output of stochastic models.
