## Research interests

### Infectious Disease Modeling and Quantitative Epidemiology
I am broadly interested in infectious diseases from both public health and physiological perspectives. Recent projects include analyzing the impact of essential worker staffing choices on the course of novel outbreaks as well as predicting the heterogeneity of outcomes during early stage epidemics that arise primarily through the stochasticity of transmission events. Most of my work in this area reflects the belief that it is important to consider both the inherent randomness of disease transmission and the underlying contact network along which a disease can spread. In particular, beyond the standard compartmental disease models, I tend to focus on dynamical models on networks and stochastic models. Current projects include inferring metabolic pathways of protozoan parasites from partially observed transcriptomes and modeling disease surveillance at the population level to guide pandemic preparedness efforts.

### Model Inference
The application of mathematical models to real world problems in epidemiolgy requires that the models are well able to generate output that "matches" observed data. A necessary step in this problem is inferring model parameters from data, this can be viewed either as a subset of of mathematical inverse problems or model fitting. My ongoing interests in this field include developing appropriate likelihoods for Bayesian inference, inference problems in the presence of incomplete data, and using inference to guide model structure.

### Uncertainty Quantification
The more traditional approach to forward uncertainty quantification, aka uncertainty propogation, is the propogate probabilistic forecasts based on the fact that model parameters are never known exactly. This is a vital step in mathematical modeling, and especially in communicating predictions that arise from modeling. An aspect of this approach I find particularly interesting is integrating inverse uncertainty quantification (calibration and or fitting of a model) with forward uncertainty propogation. In particular, I hope to develop theory to better explain how missing data impacts parameter uncertainty, thus indirectly impacting forward uncertainty quantification. Additionally, given that the spread of infectious diseases is typically viewed as random in nature, I am interested in how the effects of parameter uncertainty compound with the inherently probabilistic output of stochastic models.
