## Biography

I am a Mathematical Sciences Ph.D. Student working within the Applied Math program, and the Vermont Complex Systems Center. I am also NSF Trainee in the Quantitative and Evolutionary STEM Traineeship [(QuEST)](https://www.uvm.edu/quest) program at the University of Vermont, which allows me to bring my quantitative skills to interdisciplinary work. 

## Research interests
Network analysis for biology applications, mathematical modeling, disease dynamics and probability generating functions.
