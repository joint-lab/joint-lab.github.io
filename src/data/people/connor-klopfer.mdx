I graduated in the summer of 2021 after defending my thesis on intestinal pathogen co-infection in infants in lower to middle income countries. My work experience is in life sciences and human subjects research, having started as an undergraduate in compound testing and vaccine clinical trial testing. My strengths are simulation building, visualisation, cleaning, managing and modeling. When I'm not on a computer or doing math, I love to mountain bike, ski, canoe, and improve my cooking.
