## Biography 

I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs) at The University of Vermont, a co-Director at the [Translational Global Infectious diseases Research Center](https://www.med.uvm.edu/tgircobre/home), core-faculty of the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/), director of the [Complex Network Winter Workshop](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/cnww/), and board member of the [Network Science Society](https://netscisociety.net/about/board). My research is in complexity, network theory, and nonlinear dynamics with applications in epidemiology, biology, sociology, ecology.

Before joining UVM, I was a [James S.
