I’m the TGIR Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Vermont. My research expertise is broadly the study of dynamics on complex systems, especially the spread of contagion on interaction networks involving group (higher-order) interactions. I’ve worked in both academia and industry which gives me a unique perspective on doing science. I'm broadly interested in complex systems (particularly those involving higher-order interactions), contagion spread (disease, opinions, etc.), the structure of complex systems, and dynamical systems.
**I am currently on the job market looking for positions that start in summer or fall of 2024!**
