I recently obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
My research expertise is broadly the study of dynamics on complex systems, especially the spread of contagion on interaction networks involving group (higher-order) interactions. My research always starts with noticing things around me and asking, “why?” I’ve worked in both academia and industry which gives me a unique perspective on applied mathematics.
