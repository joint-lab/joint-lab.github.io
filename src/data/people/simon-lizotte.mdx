## Biography

I work under the supervision of [Antoine Allard](https://antoineallard.github.io/) and Jean-Gabriel Young. I’m mainly interested in numerical methods, Bayesian inference, Markov chains and hypergraphs.

When I feel like geeking out, I enjoy messing around with different Linux distributions and configuring my desktop. I also like to create vectorial figures and designs on Inkscape. Otherwise, in my free time I play table tennis, I play electric guitar and I sing.
