The Joint Lab and, more broadly, the Vermont Center for Complex Systems, hosted the [Contagion on Complex Social Systems Workshop (CCSS)](https://ccss-conference.github.io/) at the University of Vermont from August 14-16, 2023. CCSS was an interdisciplinary space for 50 world leaders and young researchers to present and discuss topics related to modeling of contagion in social systems. The unique format of this workshop featured discussion groups, extended breaks, and participants across a wide variety of career stages and disciplines. We heard about topics such as misinformation, social media influence, the use and limitations of epidemic models, adoption of behaviors, epidemic models used to analyze SARS-CoV-2 and other diseases, and the evolution of culture.
