Two lab members are joining other institutions for exciting internships this summer.
[Mariah Boudreau](../../people/mariah-boudreau/) is visiting the [Institute for Disease Modeling](https://www.idmod.org/) in Seattle, where she will work on modeling epidemics, and [Bren Case](../../people/brendan-case/) will visit the University of South Carolina as a recipient of a [T35 grant](https://bigdata.sc.edu/2022-t35-recipients/) at the [Big Data Health Science Center](https://bigdata.sc.edu/).
Congratulations to both, you will be missed this summer!
