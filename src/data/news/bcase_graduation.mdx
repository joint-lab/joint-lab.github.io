It is with great pride that we announce that [Bren Case](../../people/brendan-case/) has successfully defended their thesis entitled “[Bayesian experimental design for control and surveillance in epidemiology](https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/graddis/1778/)” and has therefore been awarded the Ph.D. title.

Dr. Case is now continuing their research as a Post-doctoral Fellow in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics department at the University of Georgia, where their unparalleled talent will no doubt continue to make waves.
Congratulations!
