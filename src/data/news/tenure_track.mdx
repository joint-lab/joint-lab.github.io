Big news. I will become an assistant professor at the University of Vermont starting this fall! My primary appointment will be with the Department of Mathematics and Statistics with a joint appointment at the Larner College of Medicine, where I will join the modeling team of the Translational Global Infectious Diseases Research Center (TGIR). Iâ€™m also staying on the faculty of the Vermont Complex Systems Center to work with all the fine folks over there, as well as on the faculty of the Computer Science department (secondary appointment). Quite a mouthful!

I will be looking to hire soon, so stay tuned.
