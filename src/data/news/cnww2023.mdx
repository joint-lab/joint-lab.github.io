After four years away from the Monastère des Augustines in Québec City, we are happy to announce the return of the CNWW to the Monastery on Dec 17-22, 2023! To celebrate, CNWW 2023 is a free event with complimentary breakfasts, lunches, and coffee breaks.

This return to the Monastery will feature a flexible structure blurring the lines between faculty and participants.  Our community has done amazing science during the pandemic. We hope to highlight that with an open schedule where all participants can present their ideas, with plenty of time for brainstorms and projects.

[Details are still in flux, but applications are open here until September 15th!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE5dSB90rMuRWhYyaQStfUB6ENoIK-q8PlLU4ShIu18AQKfw/viewform)
