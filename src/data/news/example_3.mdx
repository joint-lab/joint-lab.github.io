We had the great pleasure of having Jean-Gabriel Young (U. Michigan) with us on October 11th. Apart from working on ongoing projects and brainstorming on future ones, Jean-Gabriel gave a lecture on the Bayesian inference of network structure from observational data.

His latest preprint on the subject can be found here.
